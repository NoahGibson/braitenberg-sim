# Braitenberg Vehicle Simulator

Braitenberg Vehicles are autonomous agents consisting of simple sensors and actuators.
In most examples, the sensors detect light, and the actuators are wheel motors.
When connected and configured in various ways, these basic hardware components can lead to the vehicle appearing to exhibit various goal oriented behaviors such as "avoiding" sources or "attacking" them.

This Python-based simulator allows for the editing of basic configurations for a Braitenberg vehicle, as well as a view of its behavior in an environment of sources.
